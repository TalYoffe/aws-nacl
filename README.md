his script updates the entries of a Network Access Control List (NACL) in AWS. The script reads a CSV file with the desired entries and their configurations, and updates the NACL accordingly.

Prerequisites
Before running the script, the following prerequisites must be met:

AWS CLI must be installed and configured with access to the desired account.
The NACL ID and VPC ID must be known.
The CSV file with the desired entries must be available.
Usage
To use the script, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the repository directory.
Open the update-network-acl-aws.sh file and replace the placeholders with the actual values:
Replace <NACL_ID> with the NACL ID.
Replace <VPC_ID> with the VPC ID.
Replace <CSV_FILE> with the path to the CSV file containing the desired entries.
Run the script with the following command: ./update-network-acl-aws.sh
CSV File Format
The CSV file should have the following columns:

Rule #: An integer representing the rule number.
Rule Action: Either allow or deny.
Protocol: The protocol of the entry. Can be tcp, udp, icmp, or all.
Cidr Block: The CIDR block to which the entry applies.
Egress: Either true or false, indicating whether the entry applies to outbound traffic.
For example:

Rule #,Rule Action,Protocol,Cidr Block,Egress
100,allow,tcp,10.0.0.0/16,false
200,deny,all,0.0.0.0/0,true
